            <p>
                Precisely on Sunday 12th of April 1998, I came back from church service, had my launch, sat by my bed side to rest and ruminate through the service of that day.  All of a sudden I was knocked off into a trance while still sitting down, very conscious of my environment but yet in a trance.  A mighty hand sparkling with fire appeared before me on the wall and wrote FREEDOM CHRISTIAN CENTRE.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                At this time, I did not understand anything about church planting but I took notice of this strange occurrence and wrote everything down. I also had series of deeper revelations that has to do with healing crusades, evangelism and ministerial outreaches, meeting great servants of God and they anointed me with olive oil, spoke to me, gave me microphone to preach, etc. On one of the occasions I went out to preach, a dead boy came back to life, many souls saved and diverse healings took place. Hence, I was sent to Bible school. It was while in Bible school I understood I have an apostolic call to start the church. FREEDOM CHRISTIAN CENTRE. 
                Freedom Christian Centre started a year later on 16th April 1999
